# WS2812-AVR-Library
All code written by Thomas P.  
This library was programmed in Atmel Studio 7.0 in C language. An AVR library for the WS2812 ledstrip. This library is made for the AtXmega264A3U but can be easily modified for any other AVR microcontroller. It uses a microphone (with low pass filter) to produce light-effects for low frequencies in music.

Ledstrip security:  
1000uF 6,3V capacitor or higher across + and - terminals of ledstrip to prevent pixel damage. 300 to 500 Ohm resistor between microcontro. datapin and ledstrip data pin to prevent voltage spikes that damage first pixel.

Datapin: D8 (PE0) on AtXmega256A3U  
Using timer (800kHz) and PWM to produce correct timing for executing PWM dutycycle.
